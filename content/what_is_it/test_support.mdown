#Test Support

##Rspec
[_Rspec_](rspec.info): Unit Testing an app that does not have a database, short of mocking out nearly every functionality, posed a unique challenge, eventually solved with the use of the indispensible [test_construct](https://github.com/bhb/test_construct), a gem which creates and destroys temporary files and directories on the filesystem. All test helpers currently live within spec_helper.rb, but the app is set up to share helpers between the two to dry up the tests. As I move to write cucumber tests, helpers will be moved into shared_test_helpers where they will be accessible from both testing frameworks. 

##Factory Girl
[_Factory Girl_](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl): Factories were used to generate the massive amount of edge cases possible while minimizing the amount of code I would need to maintain as the app evolved. Originally my first few test files were manually generated via yaml but this quickly proved too cumbersome and inefficient. Factory Girl provides the ability to generate the content of the test files while allowing me to create them within the test_contruct.

##Cucumber
[_Cucumber_](cukes.info): As the current layout, content, and view helpers were written in a 2-day span to get a low level app demo up, the cukes are pending a more thoughtful rewrite of the site.
