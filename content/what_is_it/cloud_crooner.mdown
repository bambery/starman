Cloud Crooner is a gem to manage a Sinatra application's assets with Sprockets and sync them with Amazon S3 with an emphasis on smart defaults. It utilizes the [fog](https://github.com/fog/fog) gem and configures [sprockets-helpers](https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-helpers) so that assets are always pulled from the right place. 

Cloud Crooner is used extensively in Starman to navigate between memcached, the file system, and remote files to track content markdown files as well as the usual asset handling. The [README](https://github.com/bambery/cloud_crooner/blob/master/README.md) is fairly thorough for configuration and usage and there is a [sample application](https://github.com/bambery/cloud_crooner_example) to demonstrate usage of the gem, so I suggest taking a look at those to learn more.
